# Safe0x.me
The digital treasure map

Safe0x is a web app that enables digital asset owners to confidently share a reference to their assets with people they trust.

The current version is a proof of concept. 

It's built using: Nodejs and https://ipfs.io/.
# Background
With Bitcoin and Crypto assets reaching the mainstream. There is a new wealth being created online. 
Before, we used to keep our assets in bank safes. 

Our trusted family members, friends or lawyers can access our safe, they will be able to access our valuable assets. 

In today’s world, we keep our digital assets in one or multiple devices/websites. With the help of 2FA, Password management softwares and hardware wallets we can keep our digital assets secured.

# Motivation
What happens to our digital wealth when we can’t access it because of death, lack of connectivity, security or any other reason?
How can we allow our trusted ones access our digital assets?

The tricky situation is: We want to give people we trust an access when we are not available. But we don’t want to give up the private key. This is why give them a reference to the private key to access our digital wealth. Only when we can’t access it ourselves.

# Terms
The safe: is the note the digital asset holder creates on safe0x.me
